 <summary><h3>Haider's coding journey </h3></summary>
hello, I've just started my journey as a self-taught programmer. I'm a passionate about learning and building new and  cool programming projects. i enjoy working on personal projects and exploring differernt technoliges and improving my coding skills. 
 
As of right now, i'm focusing mostly on web-development, hoping to create websites and apps that can be of use for me and other people. In the future i'm excited to dive deeper into full-stack development becoming a confident programmer working on front-end as well as back-end projects.

Coding for me is a journey and i love the ups and down it has and everything in between. i'm excited to see where this journey will take me.

Thanks for stopping by and feel free to connect or give me any tips i can improve on :)
